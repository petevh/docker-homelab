# Intercom Service — Development Notes

Research and reverse engineering lives in `/mnt/development/DahuaConsole/` (separate
project). Bring working solutions here once confirmed in that repo. Full protocol
analysis is in `DahuaConsole/NEXT_STEPS.md` — read it before touching this service.

## Current Status (2026-06-12)

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| `/unlock` | **Working** | Cloud API via `dmss-di.dolynkcloud.com` |
| `/frame` | **Partially working** | Decodes but right ~25% of image is corrupt — see Stream Quality Issue below |
| `/stream` | **Partially working** | Same corruption as `/frame` |
| `/events` | **Working** | SSE stream fires on doorbell ring via direct DHIP to VTH |
| HA generic_camera | Blocked | Waiting on stream quality fix |
| HA webhook trigger | Ready to wire | Consume `/events` SSE |

## Stream Quality Issue (BLOCKING)

The VTO camera stream decodes with a permanently corrupt right quarter (~25% width, grey/noisy).
This is a **camera firmware bug** — the H264 IDR (keyframe) has corrupt macroblocks starting
at column 21 (`ffmpeg: negative number of zero coeffs at 21 1`). Both 1280x720 main stream
and 352x288 sub-stream are affected.

DMSS looks fine because it never disconnects — P-frames accumulate and overwrite the corrupt
IDR region within seconds. Our proxy reconnects every 50s (relay URL expiry) which resets
the H264 decode state and re-exposes the corrupt IDR every time.

**This is still a research problem, not just an implementation problem.**

### Possible fixes to investigate:

1. **Capture HD stream with PCAPdroid + keylog while DMSS views VTO live video** — does
   DMSS receive the same corrupt IDR, or does the relay deliver something different?
   All previous captures were sub-stream only.

2. **Request fresh IDR mid-stream** — if there's a keep-alive or RTCP feedback command
   that triggers the camera to send a new keyframe, we could do it right after connect.
   See the relay `KeepLive-Time: 60` header — there may be a companion request.

3. **Workaround: don't reconnect via relay URL refresh** — instead of reconnecting the
   relay TCP connection every 50s, investigate whether the relay connection can be kept
   alive longer (e.g. by sending keep-alive packets), so P-frames cover the corrupt IDR
   once and stay covered.


## Unlock — How It Works

The VTH does NOT unlock the door via direct DHIP (TCP/5000) — this was exhaustively
tried and is permanently blocked by firmware. See "What Doesn't Work" below.

The working path is Dahua's P2P cloud API:

```
POST https://dmss-di.dolynkcloud.com/pcs/v1/deviceuseroperate.vth.OpenVthDoor
Authorization: Bearer <DAHUA_BEARER_TOKEN>
x-pcs-signature: HMAC-SHA256 signed (see dahua_client.py)

body: {
  "data": {
    "channel": 1,
    "devName": AES256CBC(username, key=MD5(SN)),
    "devPassword": AES256CBC(password, key=MD5(SN)),
    "deviceId": "BG0142EPAJEF6EF",
    "doorIndex": 0
  }
}

Response: {"code": 10000, "desc": "Success"}
```

`devName` and `devPassword` are AES-256-CBC encrypted with:
- Key: `MD5(SN.upper()).upper().encode()` — 32 ASCII hex bytes
- IV: `b"HLMUQE2342MABCER"` — hardcoded constant from `libCommonSDK.so`

## What Doesn't Work (Do Not Retry)

### Direct DHIP (TCP/5000)
All unlock methods tried — `UnlockManager.openDoors`, `VTHMonitor.openDoor`,
`accessControl.openDoor`, `AnalogBusControl.*`, `VideoTalk2Cloud.*` — all return
error `-267976701` ("VTO unreachable").

**Root cause**: VTH firmware checks IP reachability to the VTO at `192.168.1.100`
before executing any unlock command. The VTO is on a proprietary 2-wire bus and has
no IP presence on our network. This gate can never be satisfied.

DHIP auth itself works fine (you can log in, query config, etc.) — it's specifically
the unlock command execution that's blocked.

### Fake VTO Server
Built `fake_vto_server.py` to impersonate the VTO at 192.168.1.100. Device entered
"abnormal network" state (no video, no unlock). Config does NOT auto-revert —
required manual fix via device panel. Abandoned.

### SIP INFO Unlock
VTH listens on UDP 5060. REGISTER works (user=2806, pass=123456, realm=VDP). SIP
INFO with all content types tried — all timeout. Not supported by firmware.

## Stream — How It Works

Full pipeline implemented in `dahua_client.py` (`StreamProxy` class):

1. `POST /pcs/v1/dclouduser.account.Login` → `openUserToken` (= `playToken`)
2. `POST /openapi/transferStream` with `appendUrl=/real/1/1/RTSV1` (no encryption) → relay URL `host:port/live/visualtalk.rtpxav?...`
3. TCP connect → `PLAY` request with `Accpet-Sdp: Private` header (intentional typo in Dahua protocol)
4. Response: HTTP headers + SDP (`Private-Length` bytes) + 16-byte transport prefix + continuous DHAV stream
5. DHAV piped to `ffmpeg -f dhav` → JPEG frames served at `/frame` and `/stream`
6. Auto-reconnects every 50s (relay URL expires at 60s)

The container needs `ffmpeg` — installed via `apt-get` in the Dockerfile.

VTO camera is channel 1 on the VTH (`channelSn: BF08FE7PAJE2E59`, `channelIp: 192.168.1.100`).

## Events — How It Works

`subscribe_events()` in `dahua_client.py` connects directly to VTH TCP/5000, logs in
with DHIP gen2 MD5 auth, subscribes to all events, and calls `on_ring()` on each
`IgnoreInvite+Start` event (= doorbell press).

Replay/stale filtering: VTH replays recent events on subscribe; these are skipped by
comparing `UTC` against the subscribe-time baseline. See `dahua_client.py` comments.

The container must be able to reach the VTH at `DAHUA_VTH_HOST:DAHUA_VTH_PORT`.
If using the default `traefik` network, add `extra_hosts` to docker-compose or switch
to `network_mode: host` if the VTH is on the same subnet as the Docker host.

## Credentials & Device Identifiers

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| VTH IP | `192.168.40.55` |
| Device SN | `BG0142EPAJEF6EF` |
| Device credentials | `user` / `***REMOVED***` |
| Admin credentials | `admin` / `***REMOVED***` |
| Cloud host | `dmss-di.dolynkcloud.com` |
| Bearer token | `***REMOVED***-01` *(may expire — recapture via DMSS if needed)* |
| pcs-username | `uuid\***REMOVED***` |
| VTO channel SN | `BF08FE7PAJE2E59` |
| RandSalt | `***REMOVED***` |
| Gateway API host | `dmss.dolynkcloud.com/gateway/` *(new API, simpler auth)* |

## Bearer Token Expiry

The Bearer token is long-lived but will eventually expire. To recapture:
1. Install `DahuaConsole/DMSS_patched.apk` (cert pinning bypassed)
2. Run PCAPdroid with TLS key logging
3. Open DMSS, log in — capture the `Authorization: Bearer` header value
4. Update `DAHUA_BEARER_TOKEN` in `.env` and restart the container
